# windows-kill-scripts
Scripts for killing various Windows things.

- Zoom
- F5 VPN Client

# Why
Because these programs are annoying and they either can't be "closed", or when you "close them", they hide instead.

# Usage
Download these scripts and hook them into things - keyboard shortcuts, or otherwise. 

I've hooked these scripts into the Windows Task Scheduler, and defined the following triggers:

1. `Daily` at 3:00 AM every day
2. `On workstation lock`
3. `On workstation unlock`
